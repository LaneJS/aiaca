# Content Style Guide

AACA copy should help small business owners, solo developers, and marketers act with confidence. Write in plain language and explain any required terms.

## Voice and tone
- Friendly, practical, and direct. Avoid hype and legal promises.
- Lead with the outcome for the reader before describing how the product works.
- Prefer short sentences and everyday words. Keep most paragraphs to 3 sentences or fewer.
- Use active voice and speak to the reader as "you". Refer to the product as "AACA" or "the tool".
- When introducing acronyms such as WCAG or ADA, spell them out on first use.

## Accessibility and clarity
- Use heading levels in order and write descriptive link and button text.
- Add lists for steps or options instead of long blocks of text.
- Call out safety, limitations, or legal boundaries in plain terms (e.g., "No tool can guarantee you will never face a lawsuit").
- Provide context for severity labels (e.g., "High impact" means people may be blocked from using the page).

## Product terminology
- **Scan**: a crawl of a page that returns issues, a score, and AI suggestions.
- **Issue**: a WCAG-aligned finding with severity (`high`, `medium`, `low`), description, and suggested fix.
- **Auto-fix script**: the optional embed that applies lightweight fixes at runtime.
- Use "site" for the customer's domain and "page" for an individual URL.

## Cross-linking
- Link FAQ answers to the relevant guide or dashboard help text when possible.
- Point readers to "How to read your accessibility report" for interpreting scores and issue types.
- Point readers to "How to add the embed script to your site" for install and verification steps.

## Writing checklists for QA
Before shipping copy, confirm:
1. It matches the voice and terminology above.
2. It states limitations and next steps.
3. It includes a helpful link or reference for more detail when space allows.
4. It uses sentence case and avoids jargon without explanation.
