# Cookie / Tracking Banner Decision

- The marketing site and public scan form do **not** use analytics cookies or tracking pixels.
- Because no non-essential cookies are set, we are not surfacing a consent banner at this time.
- If analytics are added later, a CMP with opt-in for EU/UK visitors must be enabled and this document updated.
